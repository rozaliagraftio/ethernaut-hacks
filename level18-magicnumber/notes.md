# **Level 18 ‚Äî MagicNumber**

## üéØ Goal  
To deploy an extremely small smart contract (‚â§10 bytes in blockchain storage) that returns the answer to `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` ‚Äî specifically, the number 42 in 32-byte format.

## üí• Theoretical background
If we write a typical contract in Remix like this:
```solidity 
contract MagicNumberAttack {
    function whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() public pure returns (uint256) {
        return 42;
    }
}
```
-- the resulting bytecode will take up tens of bytes.

To reduce the size, we need to manually craft and submit raw bytecode using EVM-level opcodes via inline assembly in Solidity.

There are **only 256 opcodes in EVM** ‚Äî each is a 1-byte instruction.

**EVM is a low-level stack-based virtual machine**, like Assembly. All arguments for operations are pushed onto the stack (LIFO order).

Essential opcodes used in this task:

- `PUSH1` ---> Push 1 byte to stack (0x60)
- `PUSH10` ---> Push 10 bytes to stack (0x69)
- `MSTORE` ---> Write 32 bytes to memory (0x52)
- `RETURN` ---> Return data from memory (0xF3)

## üõ† Ô∏èSolution steps
### 1) **Runtime code**
Let‚Äôs write the code that will be the contract‚Äôs code on the blockchain.

We want to return the number 42 from memory. To return it ‚Äî we first need to store it in memory.

- `mstore(pos, value)` ‚Äî store the value in memory from position pos to pos + 32 (not inclusive), 
- `return(pos, offset)` ‚Äî return bytes from memory from position pos to pos + offset (not inclusive).

```assembly
PUSH1 0x2a    // push 42 onto the stack
PUSH1 0x00    // push 0 (memory offset) to the stack
MSTORE        // writes 32-bytes format of 42 to memory
PUSH1 0x20    // push 32 onto the stack (the size of return data)
PUSH1 0x00    // push 0 (memory pointer) to the stack
RETURN       // return 42 from the memory from 0 pointer
```

Final runtime bytecode: `60 2a 60 00 52 60 20 60 00 f3` (exactly 10 bytes).

### 2) **Creation code**
In order for the runtime-code to be deployed ‚Äî it too must be placed onto the stack of the virtual machine, and then returned from there.

```assembly
PUSH10 <runtime-code>  // push 10-bytes runtime code
PUSH1 0x00              // push 0 (memory offset) to the stack (as usual)
MSTORE                  // store 10 bytes with padding 
PUSH1 0x0a              // push 10 - the lenght of the runtime-code onto the stack
PUSH1 0x16              // push offset onto the stack: byte position 22 in memory (padding!)
RETURN                 // return runtime-code from the memory from 22 pointer
```
This will properly deploy the minimal contract that returns 42.

### 3) **Deploying the contract** 

We write a contract in Remix ‚Äî `Factory.sol`, which deploys our tiny contract to the blockchain.

To do this, we use the Solidity assembly function: `create(value, offset, size)`, where:
- **value** ‚Äî how much Ether to send during deployment (in wei),
- **offset** ‚Äî the offset in memory from where the bytecode starts (the offset appears because bytes is a dynamic data structure, and it is always preceded by its length in 32 bytes ‚Äî an extra 32 bytes representing the length),
- **size** ‚Äî the size in bytes of the bytecode

### 3) **Verifying the deployed contract**
After deploying the contract, we use the known address to call it via an interface:
```solidity 
interface IContract {
    function whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

Calling `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` should return the number 42, proving the contract works as intended.

## üßô Outcome
We‚Äôve deployed a fully functional, minimal contract in just 10 bytes using raw EVM opcodes and Solidity inline assembly. This allowed us to successfully complete the level.
