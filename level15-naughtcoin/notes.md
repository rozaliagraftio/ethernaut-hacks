# **Level 15 ‚Äî Naught Coin**

## üéØ Goal  
To drain the token balance from my own address.

## üí• Vulnerability and Attack Strategy
The NaughtCoin contract inherits from the base ERC-20 contract written by OpenZeppelin. 
In this child contract only 1 of the 6 standard ERC-20 functions `transfer` is overridden with the `lockTokens modifier`, which prevents transferring tokens via this method (unless you're willing to wait 10 years üòÑ). 
However, according to the **ERC-20 standard**, tokens can also be moved using another method: by first calling `approve(address, amount)` to allow another address to spend tokens and then calling `transferFrom(my_address, new_address, amount)`. 
**For `transferFrom` to succeed - msg.sender** must be the address that has the approval to move tokens from my_address  and **new_address** can be any recipient. 

The part of the vulnerable code:
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public override lockTokens returns (bool) {
        super.transfer(_to, _value);
    }

    // Prevent the initial owner from transferring tokens until the timelock has passed
    modifier lockTokens() {
        if (msg.sender == player) {
            require(block.timestamp > timeLock);
            _;
        } else {
            _;
        }
    }
```

## üõ† Ô∏èSolution (via browser console +  Remix IDE)
The following steps were executed:
```js
// 1. Check my current balance - 1000000000000000000000000
(await contract.balanceOf(player)).toString()
// 2. Deploy the NaughtCoinAttack.sol contract
// (Full attack logic is in NaughtCoinAttack.sol)
// 3. Recheck mu balance of NaughtCoin ‚Äî 0
(await contract.balanceOf(player)).toString()
```

## üßô Outcome
By restricting token transfers only through the transfer function, the hacker still has the ability to withdraw tokens using other standard functions ‚Äî in this case, the combination of **approve + transferFrom**. Level completed, player's balance drained.
